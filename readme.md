Interactive Development Assignment 2

Name of Project: 
- Photo Gallery Dump

Done and modofied by:
- Teo Wei Jie (S10208226H), IT05, R(21)

Project Inspiration:
As an amatuer photographer, I want to find a platform that allows me to seek inspiration and dump all my photos for the public to view. Which lead me to think of this idea of creating a Photo Gallery Website that I can fetch photos from Pexels and Display Photos of my own. Details of this website includes photographers name (to give credits and not get called for copyright) as well as the photo taken.

API Chosen:
Pexels API (Free Images/Videos)- https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/?#photos-overview

Testing/Errors:
- Most of the Function requires the await keyword before they can display, so I missed the keyword and took awhile to fix my issue. Other than the await keyword, async is also important before the function.
- Pressing the search icon (REMOVED) will not initiate the search function as there is an error getting the image from the internet. So I removed it. Users will have to press the enter key instead.
- The navigation bar is not responsive when tested. 

Improvemens that can be made:
Some improvements for myself is
- Instead of Photos, include videos.
- Allow users to Like the photos.
- Monthly competition for the highest liked photo/video.
- Display the Photographer's Instagram for others to follow.
- Creating a Login Page for users.

*Due to my lack of focus and commitment, I could only follow the youtube tutorial and did not make anymore modification. I was fixated on another API and idea until many errors showed up and totally gave up on that idea. This was coded very last minute.

Media:
Media used in Personal Gallery are taken by myself. 
None of the images are downloaded from the internet.
Media in Index.html are images fetched from Pexels API.
