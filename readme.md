Interactive Development Assignment 2

Name of Project: 
- Photo Gallery Dump

Done by:
- Teo Wei Jie (S10208226H), IT05, R(21)

Project Inspiration:
As an amatuer photographer, I want to find a platform that allows me to seek inspiration and dump all my photos for the public to view. Which lead me to think of this idea of creating a Photo Gallery Website that I can fetch photos from Pexels and Display Photos of my own. Details of this website includes photographers name (to give credits and not get called for copyright) as well as the photo taken.

API Chose:
Pexels API (Free Images/Videos)- https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/?#photos-overview

Errors faced along the way:
Most of the Function requires the await keyword before they can display, so I missed the keyword and took awhile to fix my issue. Other than the await keyword, async is also important before the function.

Improvemens that can be made:
Some improvements for myself is
- Instead of Photos, include videos.
- Allow users to Like the photos.
- Monthly competition for the highest liked photo/video.
- Display the Photographer's Instagram for others to follow.
- Creating a Login Page for users.
